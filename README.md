# Weather Checking Application

A Python-based application that provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide. The application retrieves weather data, including temperature and conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, or cloudy), using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features
- Fetches current temperature and weather conditions for a given city.
- Detects specific conditions such as rain or clear skies.
- Provides user-friendly messages based on weather data.
- Handles invalid inputs and API errors gracefully.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, ensure you have:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```
- A valid API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Sign up for free to generate your key.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Enocko/Weather-Checking-Application.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-Checking-Application
   ```
3. Open the script file in a text editor and replace `your_actual_api_key` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python weather_checking_app.py
   ```
5. Enter the name of the city when prompted, and the application will display the current weather conditions and temperature.

## Example
Here’s an example interaction:
```
Enter the city name to check the weather: New York
The current temperature in New York is 22°C.
The weather conditions are clear sky.
The weather is sunny.
```

## Error Handling
- If the city name is invalid, the application will display:
  ```
  City not found. Please enter a valid city name.
  ```
- For unexpected errors, the program will print:
  ```
  An error occurred: [error details]
  ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Display a 7-day weather forecast using extended API capabilities.
- Integrate additional weather details, such as humidity and wind speed.
